## Terminology

+ **functions**: `R` commands that tell your computer what to do
--

+ **arguments**: inputs we give to **functions** that are used by that **function** to give some output
--

+ **packages**: a collection of specific **functions**
--

+ **running** code: the act of telling R to perform an act by giving it commands in the console
--

+ **objects**: what values are stored in
--

+ **script**: a text file containing a set of commands and comments
--

+ **comments**: notes written within a **script** to better document/explain what's happening
--



---


### Data types in `R` 

 + **Integers** are whole values like 1, 0, 220. These are classified `"integer"` or `int` in `R`.
 
--
 
 + **Numeric** values are a larger set of values containing integers but also fractions and decimal values, for example -56.94 and 1.3.  These are classified `"numeric"` or `num` or `dbl` in `R`.
 
--
 
 + **Logical** values are either TRUE or FALSE. These are classified `"logical"` or `lgl` in `R`.
 
--
 
 + **Characters** are text such as ‚ÄúCharlotte‚Äù and ‚ÄúBIOSCI220‚Äù. Characters are denoted with the quotation marks around them and are classified `"character"` or `chr` in `R`.

---
class: centre, middle, inverse

### `tidy` data

> "Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets." `r tufte::quote_footer('‚Äî Hadley Wickham, Tidy Data')`


---


### `tidy` data

 1. Each variable must have its **own column**
 
--

 2. Each observation must have its **own row**
 
--

 3. Each value must have its **own cell**

### Introducing `ggplot2`

`ggplot2` is an `R` package for producing statistical, or data, graphics; it part of the `tidyverse` collection of packages (*look at the output you get when you load `tidyverse`*).


![](https://biosci220.github.io/BIOSCI220/figs/ggplot.png)


---


### Introducing `ggplot2`

Every `ggplot2` plot has three key components:

  + `data`,

  + A set of `aes`thetic mappings between variables in the data and visual properties, and

  + At least one layer which describes how to render each observation. Layers are usually created with a `geom` function.

.footnote[See [Chapter 2](https://biosci220.github.io/BIOSCI220/dealing-with-data.html#data-wrangling-and-manipulation) of the course guide]

---
We've met the `palmerpenguins`! **Draw what (you think) the code below creates?** 

```{r pnt, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)
penguins_nafree <- penguins %>%  drop_na()
ggplot(data = penguins_nafree, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species),size = 2)  +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","darkorchid","cyan4"), name = "") +
  xlab("Bill length (mm)") +
  ylab("Bill depth (mm)")
```


<p><a href="https://ggl.link/biosci220" target="_blank">ggl.link/biosci220</a></p>

---

### Recall...

...every `ggplot2` plot has three key components:

  + `data`, (e.g., `penguins_nafree`)

  + A set of `aes`thetic mappings between variables in the data and visual properties, (e.g., `x = bill_length_mm` & `y = bill_depth_mm`) and

  + At least one layer which describes how to render each observation (e.g., `geom_point`)

+ Data visualisation is a **key** aspect of exploration and communication
+ We can **use `ggplot2`** to create informative visualisations in `R`
+ **Creating** a *ggplot* should involve **1)** the `data` object, **2)** a set of `aes`thetic mappings, and **3)** at least one (`geom`) layer.

###  Key phrases

An **experiment** is a procedure (or set of actions) where a researcher intentionally changes some factor/treatment/variable to observe the effect of their actions. As mentioned above, the collection of observational data is not experimentation.

--

An **experimental unit** is the smallest portion of experimental material which is *independently* perturbed. This is the item under study for which some variable (treatment) is changed. For example this could be a human subject or an agricultural plot.

---


###  Key phrases
 
An **observational unit** (or subsample) is the smallest unit on which a response is measured. 

If the experimental unit is split after the treatment has been applied (e.g., multiple samples taken from one human subject) then this sample is called a subsample or observational unit. If one measurement is made on each experimental unit then the **observational unit** = the **experimental unit**. 

If multiple measurements are made on each subject (e.g., human) then each experimental unit has >1 observational unit. This is then *pseudo-* or *technical replication*.

---

###  Key phrases

A **treatment** (or **independent variable** or **factor** or **treatment factor**) is an experimental condition *independently* applied to an experimental unit. It is one of the variables that is controlled by the researcher during the experiment (e.g., drug type). The values of the treatments within a set are called **levels**. 

---
###  Key phrases

The **dependent variable** or **response** is the output (or thing) that is measured after an experiment. This is what the researcher measures and assesses if changing the treatment(s) (i.e., independent variable(s)) induces any change. 

An **effect** is the change in the response variable caused by the controlled changes in the independent variable. Whether the magnitude of the effect (it's size) is significant (or or any practical interest) is determined by the researcher after carrying out some appropriate analyses.


---
### An example: `r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("coffee", style = "solid"), fill = "brown")` `r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("coffee", style = "solid"), fill = "black")` `r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("coffee", style = "solid"), fill = "grey")`


+ Three types of coffee beans are chosen: Arabica `r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("coffee", style = "solid"), fill = "brown")`, Liberica `r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("coffee", style = "solid"), fill = "black")`, and Robusta `r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("coffee", style = "solid"), fill = "grey")`.
+ 12 identical cups are chosen and sets of four cups are **randomly allocated** one of three treatments.
+ Four sets of each type of coffee beans are ground and cups made (in the same way) resulting in a total of 12 cups of coffee.
+ Samples are taken from each cup and the coffee strength is measured.

#### **Scientific question**: Does coffee strength differ between bean types?

---

#### **Scientific question**: Does coffee strength differ between bean types?

There are **3 treatments** (types of coffee beans): Arabica, Liberica, and Robusta.

In this case the **experimental unit** would be the **coffee cup** as each one is allocated a different bean type (treatment).

The **observational unit** changes depending on the scenario (i.e., what and how samples are taken). For example,

   + if a single ml of liquid is taken from each cup and one measurement is taken per ml taken $\rightarrow$ the observational unit would be the **cup**

### Three (key) principles of exprimental design

.footnote[See [Chapter 4](https://biosci220.github.io/BIOSCI220/introduction-to-the-design-and-analysis-of-experiments.html) of the course guide]

--

### **Replication**

--

### **randomization**

--

### **Blocking**


---

**Replication**

.footnote[See [Chapter 4](https://biosci220.github.io/BIOSCI220/introduction-to-the-design-and-analysis-of-experiments.html) of the course guide]

+ **Biological replication:** each treatment is *independently* applied to each of several humans, animals or plants

--

*Why?* To generalize results to population

---

**Replication**

.footnote[See [Chapter 4](https://biosci220.github.io/BIOSCI220/introduction-to-the-design-and-analysis-of-experiments.html) of the course guide]

+ **Technical replication:** two or more samples from the same biological source which are *independently* processed

--

*Why?* 
  + Advantageous if processing steps introduce a lot of variation
  + Increases the precision with which comparisons of relative abundances between treatments are made

---

**Replication**

.footnote[See [Chapter 4](https://biosci220.github.io/BIOSCI220/introduction-to-the-design-and-analysis-of-experiments.html) of the course guide]

+ **Pseudo-replication:** one sample from the same biological source, divided into two or more aliquots which are **independently** measured

--

*Why?* 
  + Advantageous for noisy measuring instruments
  + Increases the **precision** with which comparisons of relative abundances between treatments are made
  
---

**Randomization**

.footnote[See [Chapter 4](https://biosci220.github.io/BIOSCI220/introduction-to-the-design-and-analysis-of-experiments.html) of the course guide]

+ Protects against bias

--

+ Plan the experiment in such a way that the variations caused by extraneous factors can all be combined under the general heading of "chance".


--

+ Ensures that each treatment has the same probability of getting good (or bad) units and thus avoids systematic bias

--

+ Random allocation can cancel out population bias; it ensures that any other possible causes for the experimental results are split equally between groups

---

**randomization**

.footnote[See [Chapter 4](https://biosci220.github.io/BIOSCI220/introduction-to-the-design-and-analysis-of-experiments.html) of the course guide]

+ Typically statistical analysis assumes that observations are **independent**. This is almost never strictly true in practice but randomization means that our estimates will behave as if they were based on independent observations

---

**Blocking**

.footnote[See [Chapter 4](https://biosci220.github.io/BIOSCI220/introduction-to-the-design-and-analysis-of-experiments.html) of the course guide]

+ Blocking helps **control variability** by making treatment groups more alike. Experimental units are divided into subsets (called blocks) so that units within the same block are more similar than units from different subsets or blocks. 

--

+ Blocking is a technique for dealing with *nuisance factors*. A *nuisance factor* is a factor that has some effect on the response, but is of no interest (e.g., age class).

---
### Completely randomised design (CRD)

Let's consider a completely  design with one treatment factor (e.g., coffee bean type). 

--

Here, **n** experimental units (e.g., cups) are divided **randomly** into **t** groups.  Each group is then given one treatment level (one of the treatment factors). As we have defined only one treatment factor all other known independent variables are kept constant so as to not bias any effects.

.footnote[.small[Random allocation can be achieved by simply drawing lots from a hat! To be more rigorous, though, we could use `R`'s `sample()` function.]]

---
### Completely randomised design (CRD)


![An illustration of a CRD with one tratment factor and three treatment levels (A, B, & C)](https://github.com/cmjt/ggdesign/raw/main/README_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)


---
### Randomised complete block design (RCBD)

Let's consider a randomised complete block design with one treatment factor (e.g., coffee bean type). If the treatment factor has **t** levels there will be **b** blocks that each contain **t** experimental units resulting in a total of **t** $\times$ **b** experimental units.  

--

For example, let's imagine that for the coffee experiment we had two cup types: mugs and heatproof glasses. We might consider the type of receptacle to have an effect on the coffee strength measured; however, we are not interested in this. Therefore, to negate this we block by cup type. This means that any effect due to the blocking factor (cup type) is accounted for by the blocking.

---
### Randomised complete block design (RCBD)

For a blocked design we want the **t** experimental units within each block should be as homogeneous as possible (as similar as possible, so that there is unlikely to be unwanted variation coming into the experiment this way). 

--

The variation between blocks (the groups of experimental units) should be large enough (i.e., blocking factors different enough) so that conclusions can be drawn. Allocation of treatments to experimental units is done randomly (i.e., treatments are randomly assigned to units) within each block.

---
### Randomised complete block design (RCBD)


![An illustration of a RCBD with one tratment factor, three treatment levels (A, B, & C), and three blocks (rows)](https://github.com/cmjt/ggdesign/raw/main/README_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)

### Factorial design (back to slide example)

A factorial experiment is one where there are two or more sets of (factor) treatments. Rather than studying each factor separately all combinations of the treatment factors are considered. 

--

Factorial designs enable us to infer any **interaction** effects, which may be present. An **interaction** effect is one where the effect of one variable depends on the value of another variable (i.e., the effect of one treatment factor on the response variable will change depending on the value of a second treatment factor.)

---

### Factorial design 

For example, we could add another treatment to the coffee experiment: **grinder type** (manual `r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("mortar-pestle", style = "solid"), fill = "black")` or electric `r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("plug", style = "solid"), fill = "black")`). So, now we have two treatments, bean type (with three levels) and grinder type (with two levels). Recall that in a factorial experiment we want to study **all combinations** of the levels of each factor:

---
Now, our **question about the strength of coffee** would be *Does the strength of coffee vary between beans and/or grinder?*

|   | Manual    | Electric   | 
|---|---    |---     |
| Arabica   | A.M `r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("mortar-pestle", style = "solid"), scale = 3, fill = "brown")`  | A.E `r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("plug", style = "solid"), scale = 3, fill = "brown")` |
| Liberica  | L.M `r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("mortar-pestle", style = "solid"), scale = 3, fill = "black")`  |  L. E`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("plug", style = "solid"), scale = 3, fill = "black")` |
| Robusta   |  R.M `r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("mortar-pestle", style = "solid"), scale = 3, fill = "grey")`  |  R. E `r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("plug", style = "solid"), scale = 3, fill = "grey")` |

.footnote[Note:  a factorial design has **equal** numbers of replicates in each group then it is said to be a **balanced** design; if this is not the case then it is **unbalanced**.]

If an **interaction** effect exists the effect of one factor on the response will change depending on the level of the other factor:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
coffee <- data.frame(bean = rep(c("Arabica","Liberica", "Robusta"), times = 2),
                     grinder = rep(c("Manual", "Electric"), each = 3),
                     mean = c(2, 1, 1.5, 1, 3, 2.5))

### Difference in means for our observed data 

Let $\mu_\text{White}$ be the mean of Group *White* and $\mu_\text{Blue}$ be the mean of Group *Blue* 

```{r}
data <- data.frame(Group = rep(c("Blue", "White"), each = 5),
                   Value = c(7,6,4,2,2,5,4,6,11,3))

diff_in_means <- data %>% 
  group_by(Group) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(Value)) %>%
  summarise(diff = diff(mean)) %>% as.numeric()
diff_in_means
```
That is, $\mu_\text{White} - \mu_\text{Blue} = 1.6$

**Randomization test**


 + **Decide** on a metric (Note this metric can be **anything** you wish) to measure the effect in question, we chose $\mu_\text{White} - \mu_\text{Blue}$
 
--
 
 + **Calculate** that test statistic on the observed data, we had $\mu_\text{White} - \mu_\text{Blue} = 1.6$
 
--

 + For chosen number of times (*bigger the better*)
    + **Shuffle** the data labels
    + **Calculate** the test statistic for the reshuffled data and retain those values
  
---
**Randomization test**

 + **Calculate** the proportion of times your reshuffled statistics equal or exceed the observed
    + this is the probability of such an extreme result under the null
    
--

 + **State** the strength of evidence against the null on the basis of this **probability**

### `r emo::ji('scream')`  p-values `r emo::ji('scream')`

Q: **What is a p-value?**

A: Informally, a p-value is the probability under a specified statistical model that a statistical summary of the data would be equal to or more extreme than its observed value

---

### `r emo::ji('scream')`  p-values `r emo::ji('scream')`


+ **p-values** can indicate how incompatible the data are with a specified statistical model

--

+ p-values **do not** measure the probability that the studied hypothesis is true, or the probability that the data were produced by random chance alone

--

+ Scientific conclusions and business or policy decisions **should not** be based only on whether a p-value passes a specific threshold

---

### `r emo::ji('scream')` Correctly interpreting p-values `r emo::ji('scream')`

+ Proper inference requires **full** reporting and transparency

--

+ p-value, or statistical significance, does **not** measure the size of an effect or the importance of a result

--

+ By itself, a p-value does **not** provide a good measure of evidence regarding a model or hypothesis


---

### `r emo::ji('scream')` Correctly interpreting p-values `r emo::ji('scream')`

Let's go back to our in-class randomization test; how likely was what we observed, $\mu_\text{White} - \mu_\text{Blue} = 1.6$, to have occured by chance alone? Use `R` to reshuffle our data labels 1000 times:

```{r}
nreps <- 1000 
## initialize empty array to hold results
randomisation_difference_mean <- numeric(nreps)
set.seed(1234) ## for consistency
data <- data.frame(Group = rep(c("Blue", "White"), each = 5),
                   Value = c(7,6,4,2,2,5,4,6,11,3)) 
for (i in 1:nreps) {
  randomisation_difference_mean[i] <- data %>%
  mutate(random_labels  = sample(Group, replace = FALSE)) %>%
  group_by(random_labels) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(Value)) %>%
  summarise(diff = diff(mean)) %>% as.numeric()
}
## results, combine with the observed statistic
results <- data.frame(randomisation_difference_mean = randomisation_difference_mean)

```

### `r emo::ji('scream')` Correctly interpreting p-values `r emo::ji('scream')`

How likely was what we observed, $\mu_\text{White} - \mu_\text{Blue} = 1.6$, to occur by chance alone? A look at the full sampling distribution.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(results, aes(x = randomisation_difference_mean)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 35) +
  theme_bw() + theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 14)) + 
  ylab("Count") + xlab("Differences between randomised group means") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = diff_in_means, col = "#023020", linewidth = 1,alpha = 0.6) +
  annotate(geom = 'text', label = "Observed difference \n between means" , 
           x = 02, y = 100, color = "#023020")
```

### `r emo::ji('scream')` Correctly interpreting p-values `r emo::ji('scream')`

How likely was what we observed, $\mu_\text{White} - \mu_\text{Blue} = 1.6$, to occur by chance alone? A look at the numbers.

```{r}
sum(results$randomisation_difference_mean >= diff_in_means)
sum(results$randomisation_difference_mean <= -1*diff_in_means)
```

That is, out of the 1000 iterations

 + a value >= `r diff_in_means` was obtained `r  sum(results$randomisation_difference_mean >= diff_in_means)` times, and 
 + a value <= `r -1*diff_in_means` was obtained `r  sum(results$randomisation_difference_mean <= -1*diff_in_means)` times.

### `r emo::ji('scream')` Correctly interpreting p-values `r emo::ji('scream')`

How likely was what we observed, $\mu_\text{White} - \mu_\text{Blue} = 1.6$, to occur by chance alone? A look at the numbers.

Therefore, the proportion of times a value *as least as extreme* as the magnitude of the test statistic was observed is

```{r}
n_exceed <- sum(abs(results$randomisation_difference_mean) >= abs(diff_in_means))
n_exceed/nreps
```

We therefore have no evidence against the NULL hypothesis that $\mu_\text{White} = \mu_\text{Blue}$ (i.e., what we observed was quite likely to have occurred by chance alone).

---

### `r emo::ji('scream')` Correctly interpreting p-values `r emo::ji('scream')`

There are **many** different schools of thought about how a p-value should be interpreted.

Most people agree that the p-value is a useful measure of the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. The smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence against $H_0$. 

Some people go further and use an accept/reject framework. Under this framework, the null hypothesis $H_0$ should be rejected if the p-value is less than 0.05 (say), and accepted if the p-value is greater than 0.05.

### Key points

+ We can carry out hypothesis test on **without the restrictions** of having to know the mathematical form of the sampling distribution.
+ Embrace the **randomness**!
+ Simulating under the **NULL hypothesis** shows us what would happen under *chance alone*
+ The **location of our observed statistic** in the distribution of those simulated under the NULL hypothesis gives us information!


---

## Key points 

+ **Every p-value has a Null Hypothesis**: You cannot interpret a p-value without first establishing the null hypothesis it is testing


+ **Variation is the key**: trying our best to explain it really...

**Looking forward: some more terminology**

**Type I** error (false positive): declare a difference (i.e., reject $H_0$) when there is no difference (i.e. $H_0$ is true). 


Risk of the Type I error is determined by the **level of significance** (which we set!) (i.e., $\alpha =\text{ P(Type I error)} = \text{P(false positive)}$.

---

**Looking forward: some more terminology**

**Type II** error (false negative): difference not declared (i.e., $H_0$ not rejected) when there is a difference (i.e., $H_0$ is false). Let $\beta =$ P(do not reject $H_0$ when $H_0$ is false); so, $1-\beta$ = P(reject $H_0$ when $H_0$ is false) = P(a true positive), which is the statistical **power** of the test.

---

**Looking forward: some more terminology**


**Significance level** = probability of a Type I error = probability of finding an effect that is not there (false positive).

**Power**: the probability that the test correctly rejects the null hypothesis when the
alternative hypothesis is true. probability of finding an effect that is there =  1 - probability of a **Type II** error (false negative).


---

**Looking forward: some more terminology**

Reducing the chance of a **Type I error** (false positive) increases the chance of a **Type II error** (false negative). They are inversely related. 

**Type II error** rate is determined by a combination of the following.

  + **Effect size** (size of difference, of biological significance) between the true population parameters
  + Experimental error variance 
  + **Sample size**
  + Choice of **Type I** error rate ( $\alpha$ )
  

---
**Looking forward: some more terminology**

Each time we carry out a hypothesis test the probability we get a false positive result (**Type I** error) is given by $\alpha$ (the **level of significance** we choose).

When we have **multiple comparisons** to make we should then control the **Type I** error rate across the entire *family* of tests under consideration, i.e., control the **Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER)**; this ensures that the risk of making at least one **Type I** error among the family of comparisons in the experiment is $\alpha$.
